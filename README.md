I created a simple average noise, where we generate a 2D array (List of Lists) of random numbers and
calculate the average value between the neighbors along the map,in a wrapped way, so it connects it 
self.


I highly recommend use values between -0.4 and 0.4 and keep tweek by (1, 2, 4, 8) or (2, 4, 8, 16).
